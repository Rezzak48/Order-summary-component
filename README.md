## My process

### Built with

<!-- Info -->

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex box

### What I learned

- edit 1 : I get a feedback saying that The element "a" must not appear as a descendant of the button element bcz it harms accessibility, and cause an error !Ensure interactive controls are not nested! it was a new thing for me, so I tried another way to make a button behave as a linkðŸ˜Š
- edit 2 : I got another feedback about HTML Validations, saying that The element button must not appear as a descendant of the a element, so I am trying new way ðŸ˜Š
- practicing more about using rem it is really helpful more much than px unit
